# Bookings and Reservations
Bookings and Reservations Project

This project is the result of hands on development during Udemy's course called [Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/). The course is taught by [Trevor Sawler](https://www.udemy.com/user/trevor-sawler/). 

The application is a full stack web application that uses open-source and code that is developed during the lectured.  The open-source libraries and components are provided below in the list of Application Dependencies.
